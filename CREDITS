I'd like to thank to GNOME project. I learn a lot from its code
and some pieces were used in fbpanel. Correct for version 3.0,
systray code and wm icon code were copied from GNOME

Credits to all people who contributed by writing code and solving
bugs. 
	Joe MacDonald  <joeythesaint at users.sourceforge.net>
	Jens Georg     <phako at users.sourceforge.net>
	and others
	
Credits and lot of thanks to Peter Zelezny <zed@linuxpower.org>
an author of fspanel (see http://www.chatjunkies.org/fspanel/
                       or http://freshmeat.net/projects/fspanel/)
The first version of fBpanel was started as hacking around fSpanel :-)
